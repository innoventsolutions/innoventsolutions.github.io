Innovent has developed and is developing Open Source tools that can be used to develop, deploy and integrate BIRT reports.  In this repository, we host the Eclipse Update site that allows you to add our components to your Eclipse installation. It has been validated that the Update site is compatible with the latest BIRT version 4.5.0.

If you are using BIRT 2.5.1 or later the URL to paste into your Eclipse update manager is
```
 http://innoventsolutions.github.io/2.5.2
```

If you are using 2.3.2 version of BIRT then you should use
```
 http://innoventsolutions.github.io/2.3.2
```


If you would like to see the source or contribute to any of the projects you should visit the individual project sites.
